vHello<br>
This project uses the following database <br> 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows<br><br> 


I wanted to use this database to find out which one were the actors that had made the most films of each genre, <br> 
and which one of them is the one who produces the most money per film on average<br> <br> 

The first step to do this was to get a list of all the actors,<br>
each row has got 5 columns, each one containing one of the actors who appeared,<br>
and some actors appeared more than once.<br>

So I wrote this Python program.<br>

This program iterates through all the rows of the database(I named it x),<br>
if it detects that the name of that actor already is inside of the actors table, it doesn't insert it, but if it isn't, it inserts it.<br>
There also is another function called insert_zeros(), which has to do with something in advance.<br><br>

After that, I got this list<br>

It is much longer.<br><br>


The next step was to get a list of all the genres. <br>
I used this code. <br>

It gave me some errors, so I ended up using this one <br>

This one works in the following way:<br>
Iterate over all films,<br>
Iterate over all letters inside of the string with its genres,<br>
if the character is not ("," and " "), then it adds the new character to the word variable,<br>
if the character is "," it inserts the variable 'word' into the list of genres and clears the word variable.<br>
then, after iterating over all characters, as at the end of the string of genres there is no ",", it just inserts the word into the array.<br>
Also, it only inserts the word if it is not found inside the genre list.<br><br>

After doing all of this, I needed to decide how to set up all the genres, <br>
and everything that I wanted to measure about the actors. <br>
I decided that using a dictionary would be the best way to do it.<br>

The next step was to measure:
  - The genre of the films that they had appeared on <br>
  - How many films had they appeared on <br>
  - The summary of the money generated by the films that they had appeared on<br>

The first one would be the hardest.
So, I had decided to use that obsolete code that I used for making a list of the genres for this too, or at least the framework. <br>
At the end, I used the following one.<br>
![image](https://github.com/sneppington/wa/assets/140338265/a3b5825c-e915-4891-90a4-5c38522046cb)<br>
These lines of code use the same process that the other does.<br><br>
In order to mark that an 'x' actor had appeared in movies with 'x' genre, <br>
I decided to make it so the index of their names matched the index of the times that had happened or practically everything else <br>

I did that with the counter function,<br>
this function was supposed to take the column with an actor from the film row and sum depending on their index on the part of the dictionary called "name",<br>
sum the corresponding amount to all the columns from the row with the same index number.<br><br>
This is the counter function<br>

Instead of giving it the index of the row, it passes the whole row instead.<br>
The num variable was just to account for how the actors for each film were predisposed.<br>
Each film had 4 main actors, all of them inside columns called 'Star1', 'Star2'... until 4.<br>
I could have done this with a simple 'for', but this was much more cleaner.<br>
The function has a 'for' that uses the array with the information of the genres of the film to know to which columns should it add a +1<br><br><br>

A small problem that I faced at the start of making the counter function was the fact that arrays have an index limit,<br>
that can only be elongated using the inbuilt function '[name_of_array].insert()', the index limit is equal to how many objects did it have when it was created.<br>
So, each time that I saved the name of a new actor inside of the actors["name"] dictionary, I inserted into all columns (except for the name one) a 0.<br>

After all of that, I imported the CSV file into Google Sheets,<br>
I wanted to know how much money does each actor makes per film on average, so I divided the total money generated by each actor, <br>
by the amount of films that they've done.<br>
